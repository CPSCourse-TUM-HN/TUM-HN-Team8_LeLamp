# CPS INHN0018 — Group 8 submission checklist

Presentation: **09.09.2026, from 13:00**, Etzelstr. 38 / online. Duration: **15 min per team**
(as announced for the July session; the September slot order was still being arranged on 21.08).

## Required items (Moodle: "Projects: Choosing your presentation date + Submission")

| # | Item | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Video demonstrating the project in action | `docs/video/` | ☐ to record |
| 2 | Technical report — project, methodologies, findings | `docs/report/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md` (+ PDF) | ☐ draft |
| 3 | Presentation slides, **PDF format** | `docs/slides/` | ☐ to export |
| 4 | All code used in the project | repository root | ☑ in repo |
| 5 | Link to the GitHub repository holding all of the above | this repo | ☐ push to `CPSCourse-TUM-HN` |

> All materials (presentation, report, code and video) must be uploaded to the team's GitHub
> repository, and the code must additionally live in the course organisation
> <https://github.com/CPSCourse-TUM-HN>. Access is granted by Moaaz Eid (moaaz.eid@tum.de).

## Hardware handover

After the presentation the hardware must be handed to the CPS team (Moaaz). Teams that do not
attend in person are expected to arrange the handover before leaving. *Group 8 has asked Hadi
whether the handover may take place by 22.09.2026 — pending confirmation.*

## Push to the course organisation

```bash
cd Team8_LeLamp
git remote add origin git@github.com:CPSCourse-TUM-HN/Team8_LeLamp.git
git push -u origin main
```

If the repository does not exist yet, create it inside the organisation first (or ask Moaaz to
create it) and keep it **GPL-3.0**, since the project derives from LeLamp.
